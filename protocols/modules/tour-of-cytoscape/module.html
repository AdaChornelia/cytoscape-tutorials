<h1>Tour of Cytoscape</h1>
<p>This tutorial represents a high-level tour of the features of Cytoscape. Detailed instructions for specific features are provided in separate tutorials linked to from each section.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h1>Networks and Layout</h1>
<p>Cytoscape accepts network data in a variety of formats and from multiple sources. <br />TO-DO: Add gallery of images with captions representing different networks and sources.</p>
<p>Cytoscape also supports a number of autmomated network layout algorithms.</p>
    <p>For details, see <a href="https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/modules/loading-network-data/#/">Loading Networks tutorial</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Cytoscape allows the user to add arbitrary node, edge and network information to Cytoscape as node/edge/network data columns. This could include, annotation data for genes, protein-protein interaction confidence scores or transcriptomics data. <br/>TO-DO: Show data table with small zoomed in network.</p>
    <p>For details, see <a href="https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/modules/loading-omics-data/#/">Loading Omics Data tutorial</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h1>Styles</h1>
    <p>One of Cytoscape’s strengths in network visualization is the ability to allow users to encode any table data (name, type, degree, weight, expression data, etc.) as a property (such as color, size of node, transparency, or font type) of the network. A set of these encoded or mapped table data sets is called a Style.</p>
    <p>For details, see <a href="https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/modules/mapping-data/#/">Mapping Data tutorial</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h1>Network manipulation</h1>
<p>Networks can be filtered based on associated data or network properties, and can be edited and manipulated. <br />TO-DO: Add figures/captions about Finding nodes, Filtering, and Editing.</p>
    <p>For details, see <a href="https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/modules/filtering-editing/#/">Filtering and Editing tutorial</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>With the NetworkAnalyzer, it is possible to compute a comprehensive set of topological parameters for undirected and directed networks.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h1>Apps</h1>
    <p>Cytoscape’s capabilities are not fixed but can be expanded in a variety of ways with apps. The <a href="http://apps.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape App Store</a> organizes over 300 apps in categories such as data integration, online data/network import, network analysis and visucalization.</p>
