                <p>Community detection algorithms attempt to expose meaningful within a large network. The most common form of community detection is to separate the nodes of the network into clusters in which nodes are strongly connected to each other. In this optional section, we will bring a large network into Cytoscape, filter it to select relationships of a particular type, and then find clusters within the network.</p>

                <p>We will use the <highlight>Clustermaker</highlight> Cytoscape App to find clusters in the network. Cytoscape Apps can be installed from the <a href="http://apps.cytoscape.org/" target="_blank">Cytoscape App Store</a>. Clustermaker can be found at this App Store <a href="http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/clustermaker2" target="_blank">page</a>. Apps can also be installed from within Cytoscape using the <highlight>Cytoscape App Manager</highlight>:</p>
