	<h1>EnrichmentMap Analysis Pipeline</h1>
Pathway enrichment analysis helps gain mechanistic insight into large gene lists typically resulting from genome scale (â€“omics) experiments. It identifies biological pathways that are enriched in the gene list more than expected by chance. We explain pathway enrichment analysis and present a practical step-by-step guide to help interpret gene lists. The protocol is designed for biologists with no prior bioinformatics training and uses freely available software including g:Profiler, GSEA, Cytoscape and Enrichment Map.
 <p><highlight>Cytoscape is an open source software platform for integrating, visualizing, and analyzing measurement data in the context of networks.</highlight></p>

	 <p>This tutorial will take you through the EnrichmentMap pipeline workflow in Cytoscape. Key aspects covered
 in this tutorial are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Retrieve example expression data</li>
        <li>Score expression data for differential expression</li>
        <li>Perform Functional Enrichment Analysis using GSEA or g:Profiler</li>
    	<li>Create enrichment map with enrichment results</li>
        <li>Interpretation and summarization of enrichment map results</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1. Launch Cytoscape</h3>
    <p>If this is your first time launching Cytoscape, refer the <a href="http://manual.cytoscape.org">manual</a> for a basic introduction.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>2. Load apps</h3>
    <p>Go to the app store  to install the <a href="http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/enrichmentmappipelinecollection">EnrichmentMap Pipeline Collection</a>.</p>
