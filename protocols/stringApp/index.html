<h1>Cytoscape StringApp</h1>
<p>In these exercises, we will use the <a
href="http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringApp">stringApp</a> for
<a href="http://cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a> to retrieve molecular
networks from the <a href="https://string-db.org/">STRING</a> and
<a href="http://stitch-db.org/">STITCH</a> databases. The exercises
will teach you how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>retrieve networks for proteins or small-molecule compounds of interest</li>
  <li>retrieve networks for a disease or an arbitrary topics in PubMed</li>
  <li>layout and visually style the resulting networks</li>
  <li>import external data and map them onto a network</li>
  <li>perform enrichment analyses and visualize the results</li>
  <li>merge and compare networks</li>
  <li>select proteins by attributes</li>
  <li>identify functional modules through network clustering</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To follow the exercises, please make sure that you have the
latest version of Cytoscape installed. Then start Cytoscape and go
to <highlight>Apps ‚Üí App Manager</highlight> to check for new apps, install
them and update the current ones if necessarily. The exercises
require you to have certain Cytoscape apps installed. Search for
the <highlight>stringApp</highlight> in the search field; if it is not
already installed, select it and press the <highlight>Install</highlight>
button to install it. Similarly, make sure you have the <highlight>yFiles
Layout Algorithms</highlight>, <highlight>enhancedGraphics</highlight>, and
<highlight>clusterMaker2</highlight> apps installed before closing the
App Manager.</p>

<p>If you are not already familiar with the STRING database, we highly recommend that 
you go through the short <a href="https://jensenlab.org/training/string/">STRING exercises</a> 
provided by the <a href="https://jensenlab.org/">Jensen lab</a> to learn about the 
underlying data before working with them in these exercises.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>

<p>In this exercise, we will perform some simple queries to retrieve
molecular networks based on a protein, a small-molecule compound,
a disease, and a topic in PubMed.</p> 
</section>

<section>

<h3 id="11-protein-queries">1.1 Protein queries</h3>

<p>Go to the menu <highlight>File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Public
Databases</highlight>. In the import dialog, choose <highlight>STRING:
protein query</highlight> as <highlight>Data Source</highlight> and
type your favorite protein into the <highlight>Enter protein names
or identifiers</highlight> field (e.g. SORCS2). You can select the
appropriate organism by typing the name (e.g. Homo sapiens). The
<highlight>Maximum number of interactors</highlight> determines how
many interaction partners of your protein(s) of interest will be
added to the network. By default, if you enter only one protein
name, the resulting network will contain 10 additional interactors.
If you enter more than one protein name, the network will contain
only the interactions among these proteins, unless you explicitly
ask for additional proteins.</p>

<p>Unless the name(s) you entered give unambiguous matches, a
disambiguation dialog will be shown next. It lists all the matches
that the stringApp finds for each query term and selects the first
one for each. Select the right one(s) you meant and continue by
pressing the <highlight>Import</highlight> button.</p>

<div class="cybrowser">
<p><a href="cycmd:string protein query query=SORCS2 taxonID=9606" class="btn btn-primary">Import SORCS2 network</a></p>
</div>

<p><em>How many nodes are in the resulting network? How does this
compare to the maximum number of interactors you specified? What
types of information does the <highlight>Node Table</highlight>
provide?</em></p> 
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="12-compound-queries">1.2 Compound queries</h3>

<p>Go to the menu <highlight>File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Public
Databases</highlight>. In the import dialog, choose <highlight>STITCH:
protein/compound query</highlight> as <highlight>Data Source</highlight>
and type your favorite compound into the <highlight>Enter protein
or compound names or identifiers</highlight> field (e.g. imatinib).
You can select the organism and number of additional interactors
just like for the protein query above, and the disambiguation dialog
also works the same way.</p>

<div class="cybrowser">
<p><a href="cycmd:string compound query query=imatinib taxonID=9606" class="btn  btn-primary">Import imatinib network</a></p>
</div>

<p><em>How is this network different from the protein-only network
with respect to node types and the information provided in the
<highlight>Node Table</highlight>?</em></p> 
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="13-disease-queries">1.3 Disease queries</h3>

<p>Go to the menu <highlight>File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Public
Databases</highlight>. In the import dialog, choose <highlight>STRING:
disease query</highlight> as <highlight>Data Source</highlight> and
type a disease of interest into the <highlight>Enter disease
term</highlight> field (e.g. Alzheimer‚Äôs disease). The stringApp
will retrieve a STRING network for the top-N proteins (by default
100) associated with the disease.</p>

<p>The next dialog shows all the matches that the stringApp finds
for your disease query and selects the first one. Make sure to
select the intended disease before pressing the
<highlight>Import</highlight> button to continue.</p>

<div class="cybrowser">
<p><a href="cycmd:string disease query disease=DOID:10652 taxonID=9606 limit=100" class="btn  btn-primary">Import Alzheimer‚Äôs disease network</a></p>
</div>

<p><em>Which additional attribute column do you get in the <highlight>Node Table</highlight> for a disease query compared to a protein query? (Hint: check the last column.)</em></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="14-pubmed-queries">1.4 PubMed queries</h3>

<p>Go to the menu <highlight>File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Public
Databases</highlight>. In the import dialog, choose <highlight>STRING:
PubMed query</highlight> as <highlight>Data Source</highlight> and
type query representing a topic of interest into the <highlight>PubMed
Query</highlight> field (e.g. jet-lag). You can use any query that
would work on the PubMed website, but it should obviously a topic
with related genes or proteins. The stringApp will query PubMed for
the abstracts, find the top-N proteins (by default 100) associated
with these abstracts, and retrieve a STRING network for them.</p>

<div class="cybrowser">
<p><a href="cycmd:string pubmed query pubmed=jet-lag taxonID=9606 limit=50" class="btn  btn-primary">Import jet-lag network</a></p>
</div>

<p><em>Which attribute column do you get in the <highlight>Node Table</highlight> for a PubMed query compared to a disease query? (Hint: check the last columns.)</em></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="15-new-search-interface">1.5 New search interface</h3>

<p>The types of queries described above can alternatively be performed
through the new Cytoscape search interface. Click on the drop-down
menu with an icon on it, located on the left side below the
<highlight>Network</highlight> tab in the <highlight>Control
Panel</highlight>. Select one of the four possible STRING queries
and directly enter your query in the text field. To change settings
such as organism, click the ‚ò∞ button next to the text field. Finally,
click the üîç button to retrieve a STRING network for your query.</p>
</section> </section>

<section>
<section>

<h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h2>

<p>In this exercise, we will work with a list of 78 proteins that
interact with TrkA (tropomyosin-related kinase A) in neuroblastoma
cells 10 min after stimulation with NGF (nerve growth factor) (<a
href="http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/8/374/ra40">Emdal et al.,
2015</a>). An adapted table with the data from this study is available
<a href="../data/Emdal2015SciSignal.xlsx">here</a>.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h3 id="21-protein-network-retrieval">2.1 Protein network retrieval</h3>

<p>Start Cytoscape or open a new session from the menu <highlight>File
‚Üí New ‚Üí Session</highlight>. Go to the menu <highlight>File ‚Üí Import
‚Üí Network ‚Üí Public Databases</highlight>. In the import dialog,
choose <highlight>STRING: protein query</highlight> as the
<highlight>Data Source</highlight> and paste the list of UniProt
accession numbers from the first column in the table into the
<highlight>Enter protein names or identifiers</highlight> field.</p>

<p>Next, the disambiguation dialog shows all STRING proteins that
match the query terms, with the first protein for each query term
automatically selected. This default is fine for this exercise;
click the <highlight>Import</highlight> button to continue.</p>

<p><em>How many nodes and edges are there in the resulting network? Do the proteins all form a connected network? Why?</em></p>

<p>Cytoscape provides several visualization options under the
<highlight>Layout</highlight> menu. Experiment with these and find
one that allows you to see the shape of the network easily. For
example, you can try the <highlight>Degree Sorted Circle
Layout</highlight>, the <highlight>Prefuse Force Directed
Layout</highlight> with <highlight>score</highlight> as edge weight,
and <highlight>yFiles Organic Layout</highlight>.</p>

<p><em>Can you find a layout that allows you to easily recognize patterns in the network? What about the Edge-weighted Spring Embedded Layout with the attribute ‚Äòscore‚Äô, which is the combined STRING interaction score.</em></p>
</section>

<section>

<h3 id="22-discrete-color-mapping">2.2.1 Discrete color mapping</h3>

<p>Cytoscape allows you to map attributes of the nodes and edges
to visual properties such as node color and edge width. Here, we
will map drug target family data from the <a
href="https://pharos.nih.gov/idg/targets">Pharos</a> database to
the node color.</p>

<p>Select <highlight>Style</highlight> from the top menu in the
left panel (it is between <highlight>Network</highlight> and
<highlight>Select</highlight>). Click the <highlight>‚óÄ</highlight>
button to the right of the property you want to change, in this
case <highlight>Fill Color</highlight>, and set
<highlight>Column</highlight> to the node column containing the
data that you want to use (i.e. <highlight>target family</highlight>).
This action will remove the rainbow coloring of the nodes and present
you with a list of all the different values of the attribute that
are exist in the network.</p>

<p><em>Which target families are present in the network?</em></p>


</section>
<section>
<h3 id="22-discrete-color-mapping">2.2.2 Discrete color mapping</h3>

<p>To color the corresponding proteins, first click the field to
the right of an attribute value, i.e. <highlight>GPCR</highlight>
or <highlight>Kinase</highlight>, then click the <highlight>‚ãØ</highlight>
button and choose a color from color selection dialog. You can also
set a default color, e.g. for all nodes that do not have a target
family annotation from Pharos, by clicking on the white button in
the first column of the same row.</p>

<p><em>How many of the proteins in the network are kinases?</em></p>

<p>Note that the retrieved network contains a lot of additional
information associated with the nodes and edges, such as the protein
sequence, tissue expression data (Node Table) as well as the
confidence scores for the different interaction evidences (Edge
Table). In the following, we will explore these data using
Cytoscape.</p> 

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="231-data-import">2.3.1 Data import</h3>

<p>Network nodes and edges can have additional information associated
with them that we can load into Cytoscape and use for visualization.
We will import the data from an ExCEL spreadsheet derived from data
provided in the paper mentioned above.
Begin by downloading the 
<a href="../data/Emdal2015SciSignal.xlsx"> data file</a>.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3 id="231-data-import">2.3.2 Data import</h3>

<p>To import the node attributes file into Cytoscape, go to
<highlight>File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Table ‚Üí File</highlight>, then
select the file you downloaded in the previous step.  The preview
in the import dialog will show how the file is interpreted given
the current settings and will update automatically when you change
them. To change the default selection chosen by Cytoscape, click
on the arrow in the column heading. For example, you can decide
whether the column is imported or not by changing the
<highlight>Meaning</highlight> of the column (hover over each symbol
with the mouse to see what they mean). This column-specific dialog
will also allow you to change the column name and type.</p>

<p>Now you need to map unique identifiers between the entries in
the data and the nodes in the network. The key point of this is to
identify which nodes in the network are equivalent to which entries
in the table. This enables mapping of data values into visual
properties like Fill Color and Shape. This kind of mapping is
typically done by comparing the unique Identifier attribute value
for each node (Key Column for Network) with the unique Identifier
value for each data value (key symbol). As a default, Cytoscape
looks for an attribute value of ‚ÄòID‚Äô in the network and a user-supplied
Key in the dataset.</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3 id="232-data-import">2.3.3 Data import</h3>
<p>The <highlight>Key Column</highlight> for Network can be changed
using a combo box and allows you to set the node attribute column
that is to be used as key to map to. In this case it is <highlight>query
term</highlight> because this attribute contains the UniProt accession
numbers you entered when retrieving the network. You can also change
the Key by pressing the key button for the column that is to be
used as key for mapping values in the dataset.</p>

<p>If there is a match between the value of a Key in the dataset
and the value the Key Column for Network field in the network, all
attribute‚Äìvalue pairs associated with the element in the dataset
are assigned to the matching node in the network. You will find the
imported columns at the end of the Node Table.</p>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="241-continuous-color-mapping">2.4.1 Continuous color mapping</h3>

<p>Now, we want to color the nodes according to the protein abundance
(log ratio) compared to the cells before NGF treatment. From the
left panel top menu, select <highlight>Style</highlight> (it is to
the right of <highlight>Network</highlight>). Then click on the
<highlight>‚óÄ</highlight> button to the right of the property you
want to change, for example <highlight>Fill Color</highlight>. Next,
set <highlight>Column</highlight> to the node column containing the
data that you want to use (10 min log ratio). Since this is a numeric
value, we will use the <highlight>Continuous Mapping</highlight>
as the <highlight>Mapping Type</highlight>, and set a color gradient
for how abundant each protein is. The default Cytoscape color
gradient blue-white-red already gives a nice visualization of the
negative-to-positive abundance ratio.</p>
<p><em>Are the up-regulated nodes grouped together?</em></p>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="242-continuous-color-mapping">2.4.2 Continuous color mapping</h3>
<p>To change the colors, double click on the color gradient in order
to bring up the <highlight>Continuous Mapping Editor</highlight>
window and edit the colors for the continuous mapping. In the mapping
editor dialog, the color that will be used for the minimum value
is on the left, and the max is on the right. Double click on the
triangles on the top and sides of the gradient to change the colors.
The triangles on the top represent the values at which the data
will be clipped; anything above the right triangle will be set to
the max value. This is useful if you have a small number of values
that are significantly higher than the median. To have three colors,
you need to add a new triangle (for the white color) by pressing
the Add button and set the Handle position value to 0. As you move
the triangles and change the color, the display in the network pane
will automatically update ‚Äî so this is all easier to do than to
explain! If at any point it doesn‚Äôt seem to work as expected, it
is easiest to just delete the mapping and start again.</p>

<p><em>Can you improve the color mapping such that it is easier to see which nodes have a log ratio below -2 and above 2?</em></p>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="251-functional-enrichment">2.5.1 Functional enrichment</h3>

<p>Next, we will retrieve functional enrichment for the proteins
in our network. After making sure that no nodes are selected in the
network, go to the menu <highlight>Apps ‚Üí STRING Enrichment ‚Üí
Retrieve functional enrichment</highlight> and keep the default
p-value of 0.05. A new STRING Enrichment tab will appear in the
Table Panel on the bottom. It contains a table of enriched terms
and corresponding information for each enrichment category.</p>

<div class="cybrowser">
<p><a href="cycmd:string retrieve enrichment cutoff=0.05" class="btn  btn-primary">Retrieve functional enrichment</a></p>
</div>

<p><em>Which are the three most statistically significant terms?</em></p>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="252-functional-enrichment">2.5.2 Functional enrichment</h3>
<p>To explore only specific types of terms, e.g. GO terms, and to
remove redundant terms from the table, click on the filter icon in
the <highlight>Table panel</highlight> (leftmost icon). Select the
three types of GO terms, enable the option to <highlight>Remove
redundant terms</highlight> and set <highlight>Redundancy
cutoff</highlight> to 0.2. In this way, you will see only the
statistically significant GO terms that do not represent largely
the same set of proteins within the network. You can see which
proteins are annotated with a given term by selecting the term in
the <highlight>STRING Enrichment</highlight> panel.</p>

<p><em>Do the functional terms assigned to a protein correlate with whether it is up- or down-regulated?</em></p>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="253-functional-enrichment">2.5.3 Functional enrichment</h3>
<p>Next, we will visualize the top-3 enriched terms in the network
by using split charts. Click the settings icon (rightmost icon) and
set the <highlight>Number of terms</highlight> to chart to 3; you
can optionally also <highlight>Change Color Palette</highlight>
before clicking <highlight>OK</highlight> to confirm the new settings.
Click the colorful chart icon to show the terms as the charts on
the network.</p>

<p><em>Do these terms give good coverage of the proteins in network?</em></p>

<p>Finally, save the list of enriched terms and associated p-values
as a text file by going to <highlight>File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Export STRING
Enrichment</highlight>.</p> </section> </section>

<section>
<section>

<h2 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h2>

<p>We are going to use the stringApp to query the <a
href="https://diseases.jensenlab.org">DISEASES</a> database for
proteins associated with Parkinson‚Äôs disease and with Alzheimer‚Äôs
disease, retrieve STRING networks for both, created a combined
network for the two neurodegenerative diseases, identify clusters
in the network, and color it to compare the diseases.</p> </section>
<section>

<h3 id="31-disease-network-retrieval">3.1 Disease network retrieval</h3>

<p>Open a new session in Cytoscape from the menu <highlight>File ‚Üí
New ‚Üí Session</highlight>. Use the menu <highlight>File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí
Network ‚Üí Public Databases</highlight> and the <highlight>STRING:
disease query</highlight> option. Retrieve a network for
<highlight>Parkinson‚Äôs disease</highlight> and another for
<highlight>Alzheimer‚Äôs disease</highlight>.</p>

<div class="cybrowser">
<p><a href="cycmd:string disease query disease=DOID:14330 taxonID=9606 limit=100" class="btn  btn-primary">Import Parkinson‚Äôs disease network</a> <a href="cycmd:string disease query disease=DOID:10652 taxonID=9606 limit=100" class="btn  btn-primary">Import Alzheimer‚Äôs disease network</a></p>
</div>
</section>
<section>

<h3 id="32-working-with-node-attributes">3.2. Working with node attributes</h3>

<p>Browse through the node attributes table and find the disease
score column. Sort it descending by values to see the highest disease
scores. You can highlight the corresponding nodes by selecting the
rows in the table, bringing up the context menu (right-click the
selected rows) and choosing the ‚ÄòSelect nodes from selected rows‚Äô
option. You can also use one of the icons in the menu to zoom into
the selected node.</p>

<p>Look for an example for a node with a disease score of 5 and one with a disease score below 4.</p>

<p>Rename the <highlight>disease score</highlight> columns in the
two networks to <highlight>PD score</highlight> and <highlight>AD
score</highlight>, respectively, by right-clicking the name and
choosing the <highlight>Rename column</highlight> option.</p>

<div class="cybrowser">
<p><a href="cycmd:table rename column columnName=&quot;disease score&quot; newColumnName=&quot;PD score&quot; table=&quot;String Network - Parkinson's disease default node" class="btn  btn-primary">Rename disease score to PD score</a> <a href="cycmd:table rename column columnName=&quot;disease score&quot; newColumnName=&quot;AD score&quot; table=&quot;String Network - Alzheimer's disease default node" class="btn  btn-primary">Rename disease score to AD score</a></p>
</div>
</section>
<section>

<h3 id="331-merging-networks">3.3.1 Merging networks</h3>

<p>Cytoscape provides functionality to merge two or more networks,
building either their union, intersection or difference. To merge
the two disease networks go to the menu <highlight>Tools ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí
Networks</highlight>. Select the two disease networks in the
<highlight>Available Networks</highlight> list and move them to the
<highlight>Networks to Merge</highlight> list by clicking the
<highlight>&gt;</highlight> button. Make sure the
<highlight>Union</highlight> button is selected and click the
<highlight>Merge</highlight> button.</p>

<p><em>How many nodes and edges are there in the merged network compared to the two individual disease networks?</em></p>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="332-merging-networks">3.3.2 Merging networks</h3>
<p>Because the merged network was not created by the stringApp, but
rather by Cytoscape‚Äôs merge tool based on two separately retrieved
STRING networks, we now have two problems. First, Cytoscape does
not know the merged network is a STRING network, and most menu
points in the stringApp menu are thus grayed out; fix this by going
to the menu <highlight>Apps ‚Üí STRING ‚Üí Set as STRING network</highlight>.
Second, because the two disease networks were retrieved separately,
the merged network does not contain any interactions between proteins
involved only in Parkinson‚Äôs disease and proteins involved only in
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, even if the proteins interact according to
STRING. To solve this, first go to the menu <highlight>Apps ‚Üí STRING
‚Üí Change confidence menu</highlight>, set the <highlight>New
confidence cutoff</highlight> to 1, and press <highlight>OK</highlight>;
this will remove all STRING interactions, leaving only the proteins.
Then bring up the same dialog and lower the confidence cutoff back
down to 0.4; the stringApp will now query the server again to
retrieve interactions among all the proteins.</p>

<p><em>How many nodes and edges does the network contain compared to before?</em></p>
</section>
<section>

<h3 id="34-network-clustering">3.4 Network clustering</h3>

<p>Next, we will use the MCL algorithm to find identify clusters
of tightly connected proteins within the combined network. Go to
the menu <highlight>Apps ‚Üí clusterMaker ‚Üí MCL Cluster</highlight>.
Set the <highlight>Granularity parameter (inflation value)</highlight>
to 4 and choose the <highlight>score</highlight> attribute (i.e.
the overall STRING confidence score) as <highlight>Array
Sources</highlight>, select the option <highlight>Create new clustered
network</highlight>, and click <highlight>OK</highlight> to start
the clustering. The app will now run the algorithm and automatically
create a network showing the clusters.</p>

<div class="cybrowser">
<p><a href="cycmd:cluster mcl attribute=score inflation_parameter=4 showUI=true" class="btn  btn-primary">Cluster network</a></p>
</div>

<p><em>How many clusters have at least 4 nodes?</em></p>
</section>
<section>

<h3 id="35-selection-filters-and-visual-style-bypass">3.5 Selection filters and visual style bypass</h3>

<p>Finally, we want to color the nodes based on which disease(s)
the proteins are involved in. To do so we will make use of selection
filters to select nodes based on their attributes and the visual
style bypass to explicitly specify the colors of individual nodes.</p>

<p>First, to select all proteins associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease,
go to the <highlight>Select</highlight> tab, click the
<highlight>+</highlight> button, and choose <highlight>Column
Filter</highlight>. Select <highlight>Node: AD score</highlight>
in the drop-down menu and the 100 nodes associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs
disease will be highlighted yellow in the network. Next, go to the
<highlight>Style</highlight> tab and click the square just left of
<highlight>Fill color</highlight> to set a bypass color for the
selected nodes (e.g. red). Repeat this process for the node attribute
column <highlight>Node: PD score</highlight> and choose different
color (e.g. blue).</p>

<p>To select the nodes that are shared between the diseases, go to
the <highlight>Select</highlight> tab and create two column filters,
one for <highlight>Node: AD score</highlight> and one for
<highlight>Node: PD score</highlight>. Since the filters by default
are combined using the <highlight>Match all (AND)</highlight> rule,
only the nodes that have both scores will be selected. Go to the
<highlight>Style</highlight> tab to set a third bypass color for
this last group.</p>

<p><em>How are the two diseases distributed across the clusters?</em></p>
