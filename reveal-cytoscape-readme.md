Building upon the powerful framework of reveal.js, we have developed a few custom features and styles tailored for use in Cytoscape training materials. In addition to the contents below, you can learn more about using reveal.js in general from the [reveal-readme](reveal-readme.md).

## Presenting
Browse the available training materials already prepared:
* [workshops](https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/modules/contents/#/workshops) -- Specific programs compiled for target audiences; typically composed of custom slides together with general modules (see below).
* [protocols](https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/modules/contents/#/protocols) -- General tutorials targeting common workflows or protocols; typically composed of custom slides together with general modules (see below).
* [modules](https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/modules/contents/#/modules) -- Concise material focused on specific tasks; intended to be reused in multiple workshops or protocols (see above).

#### Navigating
Use arrow keys, "space" or the on-screen arrows (lower right) to navigate the slides. Take note of modules that are organized ___vertically___ within a presentation.

#### Online
You can access training materials at any time via a web browser. All content is tested in the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome. Simply navigate to the corresponding url, e.g., 

```
https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/presentations/advanced-automation.html
```

#### Offline.
You can also generate a PDF version of any workshop or protocol and save it as a local file to share or present offline. Note that animated slides do not display as separate slides in PDF form, but rather as single slides in their final form. However, protocols  should be composed in such a way to display properly in PDF. Simply append ```?print-pdf``` to the end of the url for any protocol or protocol module, e.g.,

```
https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/modules/loading-omics-data/index.html?print-pdf#/
```

## Sharing
Please feel free to use, share, copy or adapt any of the training materials you find here. They are all implicitly published under the CC0 waiver for maximum resuse potential.

## Building
In order to adapt or compose your own presentation, and you do not already have edit permissions for this repo, you can simply [fork the repo](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-tutorials). If your content is of general use, please submit a pull request and we'll be happy to acccept it.  

If you have a suggestion to make regarding the content and don't have the time or inclination to do the coding, please [submit your request in the issue tracker](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-tutorials/issues).

If you are going to edit a presentation and are not already familiar with Reveal.js, you will want to [start with the reveal.js docs](reveal-readme.md) to learn how to setup your development environment and the basics of building content.  Once you are familiar with reveal, you will want to review the common elements and custom styles available in our repo for Cytoscape presentations (see below).
